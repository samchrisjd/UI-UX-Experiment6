# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.

## Problem Statement:

1. Solution Ideation: Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app). Task: Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise. Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

2. Creating User Stories: Use personas and their goals to write user stories. Task: Write at least 5 user stories using this format: As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

3. Creating Scenarios: Select a user story. Task: Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context. Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.

4. Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping: Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app). Task: Draw a task flow diagram or user flow. Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).

5. Information Architecture (IA): Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal). Task: Perform card sorting (open or closed). Create a site map showing categorized structure.

## Output:

**1. Solution Ideation**
Exercise Used: Crazy 8s
(Creating 8 ideas in 8 minutes. Here's a summarized version.)

**Low-Fidelity Idea Concepts:**

One-Tap Booking – User selects a department and gets instant appointment slots.

Voice-Based Booking – Uses voice input to book appointments.

Calendar Sync – App suggests slots based on user’s Google Calendar availability.

Chatbot Assistant – A chatbot guides users step-by-step.

Emergency Booking – An “Emergency” tab allows faster appointments bypassing regular flow.

Family Booking – Book appointments for family members easily.

Symptoms to Doctor Match – User enters symptoms and app suggests specialist.

Queue Position Tracking – After booking, shows real-time queue updates.

**2. Creating User Stories**

**User Personas:**

Ravi, a 30-year-old software engineer, prefers fast, minimal steps.

Meena, a 55-year-old homemaker, not tech-savvy but manages basic apps.

Zara, a 22-year-old student, wants instant confirmation and reminders.

**User Stories:**

As a busy professional, I want to book an appointment in less than 2 minutes, so that I don’t waste time navigating the app.

As a senior user, I want to have large buttons and clear instructions, so that I don’t get confused while booking.

As a student, I want to receive reminders about my appointments, so that I don’t forget them during a hectic day.

As a caregiver, I want to book appointments for my parents, so that they can get treatment without using the app themselves.

As a first-time user, I want to find doctors based on symptoms, so that I know whom to consult.

**3. Creating Scenarios**

**Selected User Story:**

As a first-time user, I want to find doctors based on symptoms, so that I know whom to consult.

**Scenario:**

Ravi has been experiencing chest pain and is unsure whether to see a general physician or a specialist. He downloads the hospital app on a busy Monday afternoon, sitting in his office breakroom. Feeling anxious and a bit stressed, he opens the app and sees a prompt: "Not sure which doctor to consult? Tell us your symptoms." He types “chest pain” and is guided to a list of relevant specialists. Feeling relieved, he selects a cardiologist and books a slot that fits his schedule. The app shows a confirmation and sends a reminder. Ravi feels reassured and confident he’s getting the right care.

**4. Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping**

Task: Book an appointment via hospital app.

**Flow Diagram Symbols Used:**

Start (Oval),

Process/Action (Rectangle),

Decision (Diamond),

End (Oval)

**5. Information Architecture (IA)**

Example App: Hospital Appointment App

Method Used: Closed Card Sorting (predefined categories)

Categories Given to Users:

Appointments

Doctors

Reports

Emergency

Help & Support

Profile & Settings

Sample Sorted Cards:

Book appointment → Appointments

Find doctor → Doctors

Lab results → Reports

Call ambulance → Emergency

FAQs → Help & Support

Edit profile → Profile & Settings

**Site Map Structure:**
```
Home
├── Appointments
│   ├── Book Appointment
│   ├── Upcoming Appointments
│   └── Appointment History
├── Doctors
│   ├── Search by Name
│   ├── Browse by Specialty
│   └── Recommended Doctors
├── Reports
│   ├── Lab Reports
│   └── Prescription History
├── Emergency

│   └── Contact Support
└── Profile & Settings
    ├── Edit Profile

```

## Result:

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities is done successfully.
